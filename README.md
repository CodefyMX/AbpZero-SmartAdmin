[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/70x83r44khsjd6j3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/periface/abpcinotammodulezero)

A basic and really low budget startup template implementation of ASP.NET Boilerplate and Module Zero.

##Notes:

###General

**-This is an "under construction" proyect, it was created for my personal use, use it under your own risk**

**-The template uses smart admin (single license only). Purchase from: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0 , its a really cool template and its not too expensive.**

###Cms Module

**-Is a Pre Alfa playground only (it works ... but is not really good actually).**

**-Is not a priority and may be removed from the project.**
