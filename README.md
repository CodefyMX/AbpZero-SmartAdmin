# AbpCinotamModuleZero

A basic and really low budget startup template of ASP.NET Boilerplate

##Notes:
-This is a "under construction" proyect, it was created for my personal use, use it under your own risk
-The template uses smart admin (single license only). Purchase from: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0 , its a really cool template and its not too expensive.
-The Cms module is a Pre Alfa playground only (it works ... but is not really good actually).
-The menus in the admin area are hard-coded in the html (For now).
