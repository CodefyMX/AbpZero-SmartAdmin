[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/70x83r44khsjd6j3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/periface/abpcinotammodulezero)

######A basic and really low budget startup template of ASP.NET Boilerplate

##Notes:
##### -This is a "under construction" proyect, it was created for my personal use, use it under your own risk
##### -The template uses smart admin (single license only). Purchase from: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0 , its a really cool template and its not too expensive.
##### -The Cms module is a Pre Alfa playground only (it works ... but is not really good actually).
##### -The menus in the admin area are hard-coded in the html (For now).
