AbpCinotamZero is a basic startup template that tries to implement the ASP.NET Boilerplate and Module Zero functionality and practices, its maintained by just a couple of newbie web developers. 

##Notes:
**-This is an "under construction" proyect, it was created for our personal use, use it under your own risk**

**-This template uses smart admin (single license only). Purchase from: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0 , its a really cool template and its not too expensive.**

**-If you find any logic or code errors (there might be a lot) please leave us a message or create an issue, all suggestions are welcome**

##**AspNetZero - This is a commercial product (recommended)**

##**ASP.NET Boilerplate**
http://aspnetboilerplate.com/

ASP.NET Boilerplate is a starting point for new modern web applications using best practices and popular tools. It's aimed to be a solid model, a general-purpose application framework and a project template.
